# facialattendance
This is a prototype of a model which uses facial data to recognize, authenticate and validate attendance data of people.

Dependencies include:
1) OpenCV
2) dlib
3) cmake
4) face_recognition
5) Visual Studio C++

This code is entirely written in python as of now. 

Instructions:
Upon downloading the webcam.py file, make sure all the dependencies are met. Before running please add the path to the folder which contains all the images of faces you want to recognize in a video feed. Once that has been taken care of, the code should run normally and should easily detect faces.
